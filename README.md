# SametimeClient

This is a little test project that I put together to test mixing the
Apple OS X CFSocket libraries with the Meanwhile project.

I started with the socket.c code in the Meanwhile /samples directory and 
ported it over. 

It is all written in C, not Objective-C, which was the point of the
exercise.
